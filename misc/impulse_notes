for impulse vector:
    -we are taking dot product of normal (a unit vector) and the relative velocity
        -normal is unit vector of b.pos - a.pos
        -relative velocity is b.vel - a.vel

    -multiply the resulting velocity vector by restitution scalar (attribute of RigidBody) to get final impulse vector

    -to get velocity of each object take impulse and divide it by object mass and add it to existing object velocity
        A.vel -= (1 / mass) * impulse
        B.vel += (1 / mass) * impulse
        (we are using (1 / mass) as a scalar and using the * operator to multiply by impulse vector)
